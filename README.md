# perch

A real-time terminal dashboard for git changes. Watch your working tree update live as you edit files, with PR status and a one-keystroke in-app diff overlay.

![status: early development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-early%20development-orange)

## Overview

Run `perch` in a terminal pane alongside your editor. It shows a live-updating list of changed files with insertion/deletion counts and — when the current branch has a PR open on GitHub — a compact PR status strip with review, check, and mergeability state. Press `m` to cycle between the normal status-grouped view, a condensed flat file list, and a tree view that groups changes by directory. Press `Enter` (or `d` / `Space` / `l` / `→`) on a file to open its full diff in a centered in-app overlay, or use those same keys to toggle directories in tree mode. Updates are event-driven via filesystem watches; there is no polling of the working tree.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```bash
brew install upsertco/perch/perch
```

### From source

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Or see [Development](#development) for a Nix-based setup.

## Usage

```bash
# Current directory
perch

# Specific repo
perch /path/to/repo

# Custom debounce
perch --debounce 500
```

perch can be launched from any directory inside a git working tree — the repository root is discovered automatically.

### CLI flags

| Flag                      | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[PATH]`                  | Repository path (default `.`)                                           |
| `-c, --config <FILE>`     | Path to config file                                                     |
| `-d, --debounce <MS>`     | Filesystem debounce in ms (default `500`)                               |
| `--base <BRANCH>`         | Base branch for the branch-scoped diff range                            |
| `--no-pr`                 | Disable the GitHub PR status strip                                      |
| `--view <MODE>`           | Startup view: `normal`, `condensed`, `tree`                             |
| `--no-flash`              | Disable the row flash on change                                         |
| `--flash-duration <MS>`   | Flash duration in ms                                                    |
| `--scroll-padding <N>`    | Rows kept visible above/below the selection                             |
| `--edit-command <CMD>`    | Editor command for the `e` key                                          |
| `--log <LEVEL>`           | Logging level: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`                |

Any flag that mirrors a config setting overrides the config file. Precedence is **CLI flag > config file > built-in default**.

## Keybindings

| Key                   | Action                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `j` / `↓`             | Select next file                                      |
| `k` / `↑`             | Select previous file                                  |
| `m`                   | Cycle view mode (`normal` / `condensed` / `tree`)     |
| `Enter` / `l` / `→` / `Space` / `d` | Open diff for files, toggle directories in tree mode |
| `r`                   | Refresh                                               |
| `?`                   | Show the help popup                                   |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C`        | Quit                                                  |

Inside the diff overlay:

| Key                                     | Action          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `j` / `↓`                               | Scroll down     |
| `k` / `↑`                               | Scroll up       |
| `Esc` / `q` / `h` / `←`                 | Close overlay   |
| `d` / `Space`                           | Toggle overlay  |

Pressing a diff key opens a centered panel (~85% of the terminal) that renders the file's diff inline — colored `+`/`-`/context lines with line numbers, scrollable with `j` / `k`. The overlay lives inside the TUI (no external tool is invoked) and dismisses with `Esc` / `q` / `h` / `←` (or toggles with `d` / `Space`).

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/perch/config.toml`. All sections are optional; defaults are used for anything you omit.

### Top-level

```toml
debounce_ms = 500            # filesystem event debounce in ms
base_branch = "main"         # optional override for branch-scoped diff base
```

When `base_branch` is omitted, perch resolves the base through four tiers:
the branch's reflog fork point (recorded by `git branch <name> <start>` or
`git worktree add -b <name> <start>`), the main worktree's HEAD branch, then
`origin/HEAD`. All tiers read recorded git facts — perch never guesses `main`
or `master` by name. If no tier resolves, Condensed and Tree views fall back to
working-tree status and Normal hides the Committed group.

### `[display]`

```toml
[display]
default_view = "normal"      # startup view: normal | condensed | tree
flash_on_change = true       # flash a file row when it changes
flash_duration_ms = 600      # flash duration
scroll_padding = 3           # rows kept visible around the selection (0 disables)
```

### `[pr]`

Controls the compact PR status strip that appears when the current branch has an open PR on GitHub.

```toml
[pr]
enabled = true
```

The GitHub token is discovered from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable or your `git config`. If no token is available the PR strip silently stays hidden.

### Full example

```toml
debounce_ms = 500
base_branch = "main"

[display]
default_view = "normal"
flash_on_change = true
flash_duration_ms = 600
scroll_padding = 3

[pr]
enabled = true
```

## Colors

perch renders with the terminal's own 16-color ANSI palette, so it automatically matches whatever color scheme your terminal uses. There is no theme configuration — to change perch's colors, change your terminal's palette.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- Or [Nix](https://nixos.org/) + [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for a reproducible dev environment

### With Nix (recommended)

```bash
direnv allow  # one-time setup, auto-activates on cd
cargo run     # run the app
cargo test    # run tests
```

### Without Nix

```bash
rustup show           # installs toolchain from rust-toolchain.toml
cargo run             # run the app
cargo test            # run tests
cargo clippy          # lint
cargo fmt             # format
```

### Dev install (run your local build as `perch`)

```bash
cargo dev-install                 # build debug + symlink into ~/.local/bin
cargo run -p xtask -- uninstall   # remove the symlink
```

This symlinks `target/debug/perch` into `~/.local/bin/perch`, so every later
`cargo build` is instantly live. It does **not** touch a Homebrew-installed
`perch` (that lives in the brew prefix); which one runs depends on PATH order —
the command warns if `~/.local/bin` is missing from PATH or shadowed.

### Nix commands

```bash
nix flake check       # build + clippy + fmt
nix build             # build the package (output in ./result)
nix run               # build and run
nix flake update      # update pinned dependencies
```
